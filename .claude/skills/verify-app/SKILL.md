# Verify the whole ISBN Reader

Run these skills one after another, each with the Skill tool, in one browser session. Shared setup, closing check and report format are in `common.md` (this folder); `fake-camera.js` lives here too.

1. `verify-strings`
2. `verify-card`
3. `verify-lists`
4. `verify-scan`
5. `verify-lookup`
6. `verify-stats`

End with one combined table (skill, checks passed / failed / not run). The commit gate `.claude/hooks/verify-gate.sh` lists the skills a commit needs, from the files changed.
